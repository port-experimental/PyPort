# PyPort Development TODO List

## Comprehensive Test Suite
- Create a mock client for testing without making real API calls
- Implement request recording and playback functionality
- Add utilities for simulating different API responses
- Develop unit tests for all API service classes
- Create integration tests for core functionality
- Add test fixtures for common scenarios
- Implement CI/CD integration for automated testing
- Achieve high code coverage (>90%)
- Document testing best practices

## Pagination Support
- Add page and per_page parameters to list methods
- Implement automatic pagination with auto_paginate parameter
- Create iterator pattern for paginated results
- Support lazy loading of pages
- Add progress callbacks for long-running operations
- Handle API-specific pagination quirks
- Document pagination behavior
- Add examples of different pagination approaches

## Consistent Return Values
- Define consistent patterns for different types of endpoints
- Update all API service classes to follow these patterns
- Add raw parameter to control whether to return raw responses
- Implement response processing for different endpoint types
- Consider using dataclasses or Pydantic models for responses
- Create models for common response types
- Add type conversion utilities
- Ensure backward compatibility
- Document return value structures

## Enhanced Retry Logic
- Implement exponential backoff algorithm with jitter
- Add configurable retry settings (max_retries, retry_delay, etc.)
- Support different retry strategies
- Add ability to customize retry conditions
- Respect Retry-After headers from the server
- Only retry idempotent requests by default
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for persistent errors
- Add hooks for custom retry handling
- Improve retry logging with detailed information
- Add retry statistics

## Performance Optimizations
- Optimize masking of sensitive data to avoid unnecessary recursion for large objects
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Optimize JSON serialization/deserialization for large payloads
- Add support for connection pooling to reuse HTTP connections
- Implement request batching for bulk operations

## Code Structure and Organization
- Standardize method signatures across all API service classes
- Implement consistent parameter naming conventions
- Create a more modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Improve import structure to avoid circular dependencies
- Organize code into logical packages based on functionality

## Code Quality and Maintainability
- Improve type hints with more specific types for complex data structures
- Add more comprehensive docstrings with detailed examples
- Implement consistent error handling patterns across all modules
- Add more inline comments for complex logic
- Implement consistent naming conventions for variables and functions

## Feature Enhancements
- Add context manager support for the client (with statement)
- Implement resource pooling for efficient client usage
- Add batch operations for bulk API calls
- Implement automatic request throttling to prevent rate limiting
- Add support for custom serializers/deserializers

## Testing Improvements
- Add more edge case tests for error conditions
- Implement integration tests against a mock API server
- Add performance tests for critical operations
- Implement property-based testing for API models
- Add load testing for concurrent operations

## Long-term Roadmap
- Configuration Management (environment variables, config files, etc.)
- API Versioning Support (version parameter, adapters for different versions)
- Async Support (AsyncPortClient, async methods, etc.)
