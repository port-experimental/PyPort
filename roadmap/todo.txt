# PyPort Development TODO List

## Version 0.2.5 (Completed)

### Code Structure and Organization
- ✅ Create a BaseAPIService class with common functionality for all API services
- ✅ Extract common patterns from existing API service classes
- ✅ Standardize method signatures across all API services
- ✅ Improve type hints for complex data structures and API responses
- ✅ Reduce code duplication in API service classes
- ✅ Ensure consistent parameter naming across all methods

### Error Handling and Logging
- ✅ Consolidate error handling approaches across all API services
- ✅ Enhance logging with more context about API requests and responses
- ✅ Optimize retry logic for better handling of transient errors
- ✅ Improve error messages to be more actionable for users
- ✅ Add more detailed logging for debugging purposes
- ✅ Ensure consistent error handling patterns across the codebase

## Future Versions
