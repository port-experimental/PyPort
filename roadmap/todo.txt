# PyPort Development TODO List

## Version 0.2.5 (Completed)

### Code Structure and Organization
- ✅ Create a BaseAPIService class with common functionality for all API services
- ✅ Extract common patterns from existing API service classes
- ✅ Standardize method signatures across all API services
- ✅ Improve type hints for complex data structures and API responses
- ✅ Reduce code duplication in API service classes
- ✅ Ensure consistent parameter naming across all methods

### Error Handling and Logging
- ✅ Consolidate error handling approaches across all API services
- ✅ Enhance logging with more context about API requests and responses
- ✅ Optimize retry logic for better handling of transient errors
- ✅ Improve error messages to be more actionable for users
- ✅ Add more detailed logging for debugging purposes
- ✅ Ensure consistent error handling patterns across the codebase

## Future Versions

### Testing Improvements (v0.2.6)
- Increase test coverage for modules with lower coverage
- Implement a mock server for API testing
- Enhance integration tests to cover more real-world scenarios
- Add more edge case tests for error conditions
- Implement property-based testing for API models

### Documentation (v0.2.6)
- Generate comprehensive API reference documentation
- Add more usage examples for common operations
- Create step-by-step tutorials for complex operations
- Improve inline documentation and docstrings
- Add architecture documentation for contributors

### Feature Enhancements (v0.2.7)
- Add context manager support for the client (with statement)
- Implement resource pooling for efficient client usage
- Add batch operations for bulk API calls
- Implement automatic request throttling to prevent rate limiting
- Add support for custom serializers/deserializers

### Performance Optimizations (v0.2.7)
- Implement connection pooling for better performance
- Add caching for frequently accessed resources
- Batch multiple requests together when possible
- Optimize sensitive data masking for better performance
- Implement more efficient JSON parsing

## Long-term Roadmap
- Configuration Management (environment variables, config files, etc.)
- API Versioning Support (version parameter, adapters for different versions)
- Async Support (AsyncPortClient, async methods, etc.)
- CLI Tool for common operations
- Framework Integrations (FastAPI, Django, etc.)
